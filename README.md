Project Description:

In this project, I have created a web page using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The purpose of this page is to display playlists from the Spotify music streaming platform using the Spotify Developer API.

To achieve this, I first used HTML to create the basic structure of the page. I included a header, a navigation bar, and a main content section where the playlists would be displayed.

Next, I used JavaScript to make a request to the Spotify API and retrieve data on the playlists. I used the Fetch API to send a GET request to the Spotify API endpoint and receive a JSON response containing the data on the playlists. I then used JavaScript to parse the JSON data and extract the relevant information, such as the playlist names and the track lists.

Finally, I used CSS to style the page and make it more visually appealing. I added colors, fonts, and layout to the page, making it easy to navigate and read.

The end result is a web page that displays playlists from Spotify in an attractive and user-friendly way, with easy-to-read information on each playlist and its tracks. This project demonstrates the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in building a dynamic web page that interacts with a public API to retrieve data and display it to users.
